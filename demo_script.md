### Demo Flow

This demonstration will guide you through the complete user journey, from initial interaction to final personalized homepage.

## 1. Initial Blank Canvas

**What to Show:**
- The minimalist interface with just a blinking cursor
- The subtle background that adapts based on time of day

**Script:**
"When users first arrive at the Naible homepage, they're greeted not with overwhelming information, but with a simple, inviting blinking cursor.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**

- The focus is entirely on starting a conversation
- This approach is fundamentally different from traditional homepages that bombard users with information

## 2. Conversation Initiation

**What to Show:**
- Clicking anywhere or pressing any key to begin
- The first question appearing with typewriter animation

**Script:**
"To begin the experience, users can simply click anywhere on the screen or press any key. Watch how the first question appears with a natural typewriter effect, as if someone is typing it in real-time. This creates a more human, conversational feel rather than static text appearing all at once."

## 3. Goal Question

**What to Show:**
